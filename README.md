Hi there.
I love pizza. And in my city there is really good pizza with treeible website. This repo - cry of my soul. I tried to fix many problems on theirs website and this doing led me to re-creatinon the project from scratch. 

### Technologies 

**Font-end:**
<br/>
I am, as a Front-end developer, tried to use technologies that I really love:
* ReactJS with TypeScript
* MobX
* Axios
* etc.
<br/>
I believe, that this technologies is awesome for the task, which I faced.

**Back-end**
<br/>
And here, as a Back-end javascript developer, i tried to use such technologies with Node JS as: 
* Express
* mongoose 
<br/>
Why? Because it's easy and fast to expand. To be honest, in this repository I represent my the first try to develop not an toy back-end. And I think, that this experience not so bad for the first time.

### DataBase 
I love MongoDB. I sure, that this one is the best tehonolgy to develop pet-project with little data. It is fast and free. Moreover, you can find many libraries for many languages, which would help you to use MongoDB easier. I used mongoose for Node JS in this case and fully satisfied by my choise.
On the picture below you can see database architecture. Not so good, but not bad, isn't it?
